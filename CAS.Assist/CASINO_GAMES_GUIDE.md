## 📊 Understanding the Results

### Key Metrics Explained:

**House Edge:**
- The casino's mathematical advantage
- Lower is better for players
- Example: 1% edge = lose $1 per $100 wagered (on average)

**Return to Player (RTP):**
- Percentage of money returned to players
- Higher is better
- Example: 98% RTP = 2% house edge

**Expected Value (EV):**
- Average profit/loss per bet
- Negative EV = losing bet
- Example: -$0.50 EV = lose 50 cents per bet on average

**Win Rate:**
- Percentage of bets that win
- NOT the same as house edge!
- You can win 48% of hands but still lose money overall

## 🎓 Educational Insights

### What These Simulations Teach:

1. **No Betting System Works**
   - Martingale, Fibonacci, D'Alembert all fail
   - House edge applies to every bet
   - Past results don't affect future outcomes

2. **All Casino Games Favor the House**
   - Every game has a built-in edge
   - Long-term, the house always wins
   - Short-term variance creates winners

3. **Skill Matters (Sometimes)**
   - Blackjack: Basic strategy reduces edge to 0.5%
   - Poker: Skill-based, can be profitable
   - Roulette/Slots: No skill, pure luck

4. **Volatility vs House Edge**
   - Low edge doesn't mean you'll win
   - High volatility = bigger swings
   - Slots have high edge AND high volatility
