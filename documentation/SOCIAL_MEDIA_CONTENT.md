## 📅 WEEK 1: BLACKJACK FOCUS

### Monday - Twitter/X
**Tweet:**
```
🃏 Blackjack Tip of the Day:

Always split Aces and 8s.
Never split 10s.

Why? Two Aces = Two chances at 21
Two 8s = Escape from 16 (worst hand)
Two 10s = Already have 20 (great hand!)

### Friday - Facebook
**Post:**
```
🎰 WEEKEND CASINO TIP 🎰

Planning to play blackjack this weekend?

Here's the #1 rule that will save you money:

👉 Only play at tables that pay 3:2 for blackjack

Avoid 6:5 tables - they increase the house edge by 1.4%!

On a $10 bet:
• 3:2 pays $15
• 6:5 pays only $12

Over 100 hands, that's a $300 difference! 💰

## 📅 WEEK 3: ROULETTE & CRAPS

### Monday - Twitter/X
```
🎡 Roulette Reality Check:

European Roulette: 2.7% house edge
American Roulette: 5.26% house edge

That double zero (00) nearly DOUBLES the house edge!

Always choose European when available.

**Post:** Roulette Wheel Comparison
**Caption:**
```
🔴⚫ European vs American Roulette

European: 37 numbers (0-36)
American: 38 numbers (0, 00, 1-36)

That ONE extra number doubles the house edge!

On $100 in bets:
• European: Lose $2.70
• American: Lose $5.26

Choose wisely! 🎯

### Wednesday - TikTok
**Video:** "Best Bet in the Casino"
```
🎲 The BEST bet in any casino:

Craps - Pass Line with Odds

Compare to:
• Slots: 2-15% house edge
• Roulette: 2.7-5.3%
• Blackjack: 0.5% (with perfect play)

Craps odds bet = 0% house edge! 🤯
