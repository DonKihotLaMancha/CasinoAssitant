## üß™ HOW TO TEST

### Check DNS Propagation:
1. Go to: https://www.whatsmydns.net
2. Enter: `betsage.com`
3. Select: `A`
4. Click "Search"
5. You should see GitHub's IPs (185.199.108.153, etc.)

### Check If Site Is Live:
1. Open incognito browser
2. Visit: https://betsage.com
3. If you see your BetSage site = SUCCESS! ‚úÖ
4. If you see maintenance page = Still propagating ‚è≥

### Force DNS Refresh (Windows):
```bash
ipconfig /flushdns
```

---

## üîç TROUBLESHOOTING

### "Site is undergoing maintenance"
**Cause:** DNS not propagated yet  
**Solution:** Wait 24-48 hours

### "This site can't be reached"
**Cause:** DNS records incorrect  
**Solution:** Verify A records point to GitHub IPs

### "Not Secure" Warning
**Cause:** SSL not generated yet  
**Solution:** Wait for GitHub to generate certificate (automatic)

### "404 - File not found"
**Cause:** CNAME file missing or incorrect  
**Solution:** Verify CNAME file contains only: `betsage.com`

## üìä GITHUB PAGES SETTINGS

### To Verify Your Settings:
1. Go to: https://github.com/DonKihotLaMancha/CasinoAssitant/settings/pages
2. Check:
   - ‚úÖ Source: Deploy from branch `main`
   - ‚úÖ Custom domain: `betsage.com`
   - ‚úÖ Enforce HTTPS: Checked (after DNS propagates)

---

## üéØ WHAT HAPPENS NEXT

### Automatic Process:
1. **DNS Propagation** (0-48 hours)
   - Your domain registrar updates nameservers
   - Changes spread across global DNS network
   - Different locations see changes at different times

2. **GitHub Verification** (after DNS)
   - GitHub detects your custom domain
   - Verifies DNS records are correct
   - Shows green checkmark in settings

3. **SSL Certificate** (automatic)
   - GitHub requests certificate from Let's Encrypt
   - Certificate issued (free)
   - HTTPS enabled automatically
   - "Enforce HTTPS" checkbox becomes available

4. **Site Goes Live!** üéâ
   - betsage.com loads your BetSage site
   - www.betsage.com redirects to betsage.com
   - Secure HTTPS connection
   - Ready for visitors!

---

## üí° PRO TIPS

### Speed Up DNS Propagation:
- Use Cloudflare DNS (faster propagation)
- Lower TTL values before making changes
- Use 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS) for testing

### Monitor Your Site:
- Set up Google Analytics
- Use UptimeRobot for monitoring
- Check Search Console for SEO

### After Site Goes Live:
1. Submit sitemap to Google
2. Test on mobile devices
3. Check all links work
4. Verify ads display correctly
5. Test affiliate links
