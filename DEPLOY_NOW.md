## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Still Getting 404?

#### Clear Browser Cache:
- **Chrome/Edge:** `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- **Firefox:** `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
- **Safari:** `Cmd + Option + E`

#### Check Deployment Status:
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click your project
3. Check latest deployment status
4. Should say: "Ready" with green checkmark ✅

#### Verify Files Deployed:
1. In Vercel dashboard
2. Click latest deployment
3. Click "Source" tab
4. Verify these files exist:
   - ✅ `index.html`
   - ✅ `404.html`
   - ✅ `test.html`
   - ✅ `vercel.json`
   - ✅ `games/` folder with all HTML files

## 📊 What Changed in `vercel.json`

### ❌ OLD (Broken):
```json
{
  "builds": [...],
  "routes": [...]
}
```

### ✅ NEW (Fixed):
```json
{
  "rewrites": [...],
  "redirects": [...]
}
```

**Why?** Vercel deprecated `builds` and `routes` syntax. The new syntax uses `rewrites` and `redirects` which work correctly.
